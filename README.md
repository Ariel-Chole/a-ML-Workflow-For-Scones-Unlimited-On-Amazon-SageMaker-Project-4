# A ML Workflow For Scones Unlimited On Amazon SageMaker
This is the final project for Udacity Phase-2 Nanodegree program sponsored by AWS.
For your second Lambda function, you need to remove "import sagemaker" and try to find out an alternative way to solve this issue. Hint: You have to create new policy. 
The test function for 1st and the rest two lambada functions are different. 
Before testing your lambda functions, don't forget to attach required policy permissions as per function.
